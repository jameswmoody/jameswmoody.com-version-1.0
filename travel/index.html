          <p>A few years ago, I set a goal for myself. Up until then, I had barely visited a different timezone, let alone the rest of the world. I had recently turned 21 and decided now was the time to get out and see everything I still can. I decided I'd set the somewhat modest goal of visting all 50 states before I turn 30. As you can see below, I'm getting pretty close but I still have a few more to go.
          <br><br>
          I've also stared making a few internation trips as well. So far that includes Korea, Japan, Mexico and Canada, but I am hoping to add a lot more to the list soon.

          <p>Nearly a decade ago, I moved to Chicago for college and have yet to leave. Who could blame me, there's tons of stuff to keep you interested for a while.

          <p>My first visit to NYC was in 2003. Since then I’ve been there quite a few times and it’s interesting to see the changes over the nearly two decades since my first visit. It might not have the same edge it had in the 70’s, 80’s, and 90’s but as long as Sylvia’s in Harlem still exists, I’ll always have a reason to go back. <a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/nyc"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>Surprisingly, I’ve only been to Vegas once. I think a big part of this is my fear that no Vegas trip will ever come close to the first time.

          <p>The District of Columbia has a somewhat special place in my heart. At 10 years old on a school trip, it was the first major city I had ever visited. Also, during high school I thought for sure I'd be going to Howard. I don't know if I could've tolerated all the weird slang the locals use so maybe I made the right choice. At the end of 2011 I spent a few days there partaking in pre-New Year activities. Since this was pretty early on in the travel endeavors, I didn't have the foresight to take more pictures. Until I make my way back, you'll have to settle for these.  <a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/dc"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>If it wasn't for the insane cost of living, SF would probably be the next place I'd call home. For such a small area, there is so much you could do in one day.

          <p>Gary sort of pissed me off. I'd found through a Google search that Gary, IN had a Coney Island (see the Detroit gallery above) and made an almost hour drive from Chicago to get my hands on a coney dog. I’d learn that not only was there no coney dog, there was nothing about the place that warranted painting Coney Island on the building. There was a consolation prize, however.

          <p>St. Louis has a lot of weird people. I mean that in the most loving way possible. Seriously, I saw a lot of weird, random stuff in this city. But I'll say it has a unique character unlike any other place I've been so far. There also was a ton of public art here. You don't really see a ton of that in the Midwest. The highlight was the City Museum which is essentially a warehouse/playground/junkyard/giant art exibit.

          <p>In 2013, I stopped through Indy on the way to Louisville around Christmas time. There was more to look at downtown than I expected, but it was still Indianapolis after all.

          <p>I think the best thing about my visit to Louisville was stopping by the Muhammad Ali Center in Downtown Louisville.

          <p>To be fair, most of my frustrations with Phoenix stem from Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport. Without fail, every experience with this airport has been a nightmare for me. From 6 hour delays to a major malfunction shortly after takeoff, I'm convinced this airport is cursed which is why I vowed to never fly through it again.

Either way, out of all of the 'party streets' in the country that I’ve been to (such as Beale or Division streets), 6th street was the best. The were people of all ages, races, and backgrounds there for one reason: to have a good time. No fights or drama, just good times. Later on, we stopped at Torchy’s Tacos where I had a ‘White Trash’ taco that featured potato salad on top of a strip of fried chicken as well as 'The Republican' which had jalapeño sausage, cheese and pico.

I’ve heard people say it before but it really does look a lot smaller in person. Also noteworthy: The Saltlick. This place was in the middle of nowhere Texas (yeah, THAT kind of Texas) but was an oasis of smoked meats in a desert of ranches and 'Merica-ness. They saw me struggling to get a good picture of the smoke pit so they let me come around the counter to get a good shot from the kitchen. You can find it in this album so take a look if you want to see what meat heaven looks like.<a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/sa"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>Hmm, what nice things can I say about Houston?…Well, my favorite rapper from the south, Scarface, is from there so that’s pretty cool. I’d be hard pressed to find anything else interesting about this place. To Houston’s credit, I feel like I may have liked it a bit better if I had family or friends there. To a complete outsider though, it’s a boring, hot, moist place with mosquitos the size of humming birds.<a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/hou"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>During my last week working at Apple in 2015, I decided to book a flight out to Cupertino to check out HQ as an employee while I still could. They gave me a badge and I had free range to all of the internal public areas of the campus. After leaving, I decided to also walk through Google’s campus which is much more open and accessible than Apple’s (go figure). I ended the trip by stopping by other cities around Silicon Valley such as Sunnyvale, Palo Alto, and Redwood City. I ended the trip by hanging around downtown San Jose, drinking at a few bars and eating a burger and shake at Johnny Rockets.<a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/sj"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>If you can’t already tell from some of places I’ve written about, I love BBQ. In addition to my 50 states goal, I also have a sub-mission of traveling to all of the famous BBQ cities and seeing which is the best. As you can see, I’ve been to Memphis, Austin, Nashville, and St. Louis so far. As of yet, Kansas City has the best BBQ in my opinion of taste. There is a heavy focus on sauce here, which is my favorite part about BBQ so it was only natural that KC would win with me. I was there during Memorial Day Weekend which also happens to be one of the best BBQ holidays.<a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/kc"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>We didn’t spend much time in Des Moines, we were just passing through on the way back to Chicago from Kansas City. I had never been to Iowa before though, so I had to make a stop. There was as street festival going on in West Des Moines, possibly the most Main Street America-iest place that exists. After checking that out, we stopped at a barcade downtown that was surprisingly packed for 2pm on a Sunday.

          <p>As a Detroiter I have a natural-born hatred for anything Ohio, but even more-so for anything Cleveland. Still, it was a place I hadn’t been before so we made the drive there and stayed for a weekend. Great Lakes Brewery, East 99th/St. Clair, and an Indians game were all points of interest, but the biggest highlight of the trip was visiting the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. The name is a bit deceiving since this museum covers nearly every genre of American music. I saw artifacts from all types of artists such as Jimi Hendrix, Biggie Smalls, Funkadelic, The Beatles, Michael Jackson, and Kurt Cobain to name a few. The only thing that could have made this place better was if it were in a different state. Did I mention I hate Ohio?<a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/cle"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>I’ve always had a weird fascination with being in the desert. Maybe it’s because it’s such a big contrast from the Midwest where I have spent my entire life. Visiting Monument Valley had been on my bucket list for a few years when I decided to finally make it happen. Two flights and a three hour car ride later, I was finally there. I spent the next four days drifting through the desert in a Mustang exploring everything between Flagstaff, AZ and Moab, UT.

          <p>My girlfriend and I decided to take a road trip down to Nashville before it would get too cold to travel anywhere. It was here that I was able to experience hot chicken for the first time (look it up) as well as the country bar Honky Tonk. I’m not too big on country music but I wasn’t about to let that stop me from an authentic Nashville trip.

I want to see everything I possibly can, even the things that might not be considered typical or interesting. That said, I had a good time in Omaha.

          <p>Before visiting Korea in early 2015, I had never really been outside of the country. Sure I had visited a few close places in Canada, but growing up 5 minutes away from the border makes it even less impressive than it already is. My first stop was in Seoul but I also took a train to other major cities like Busan and Daegu. It took some getting used to the food here but eventually I found myself craving kimchi with every meal. We also stopped by the DMZ which is the border between North and South Korea. It was weird how Disneyland-like everything felt there, especially considering the two countries are still technically at war. I snuck a few photos of North Korea while I was there.<a href="http://jameswmoody.com/travel/kor"><button class="btn btn-default btn-xs">Photos</button></a></p><br>

          <p>On the way back to the US from Korea, I had a short layover in Japan. However, the plane that was supposed to pick me up from Tokyo had been delayed due to a snowstorm in NYC.
